# Crow's Nest

Write a program that will announce the appearance of something "off the larboard bow" to the captain of the ship.

Note that you need to "a" before a word starting with a consonant.

```
C:\PS> ./crowsnest.ps1 narwhal
Ahoy, Captain, a narwhal off the larboard bow!
```

Or "an" before a word starting with a vowel:

```
C:\PS> ./crowsnest.ps1 octopus
Ahoy, Captain, an octopus off the larboard bow!
```
